How can you use different string methods in Java to perform various operations such as checking equality, ignoring case, getting the length, finding a character at a specific index, finding the index of a character, checking if a string is empty, converting to upper or lower case, trimming whitespace, and replacing characters in a string?

Write the Java code to demonstrate these operations using the string `"Nebuchadnezar"`.
